I ended up working and living in Thailand for only one year. Most of my friends said it would last only a few months, so I'm glad I could at least stick it out that long. 
I've come to realise many people have decided, like me, to relocate to Thailand from the West.
There are many good and bad things about living in another country. I have been back in Australia for a while now and I suppose it is a good time to reflect on the experience.
Accommodation
Of course, comparatively speaking, the accommodation is cheaper in Thailand than in Australia. But the salary is significantly lower. Then again, without speaking Thai, it would be very frustrating to find accommodation. I didn't manage to get very far without my (then) Thai girlfriend, who was able to liaise with her colleagues and find out places for rent.
After living in a hotel room for around five months, I finally found a beautiful three-bedroom house in a small housing estate or “village”.

But most of the teachers in the centre were living in small hotel rooms, so if you don't have a lot of money or any Thai connections, you can expect to stay in a condo, which is basically a glorified hotel room. If you work as an English teacher that will be the best you could afford.

This is where my snobbishness comes in. I really wanted to live in a house or a nice apartment. Even though living in one of the smaller condos was an acceptable option, it was not what I wanted to do.

So we found a lovely 3 bedroom house with a good lounge room and kitchen. The cost of rent, which was around $650 AUD, was about one-third of my monthly salary. For the most part, I was hoping to receive rental income from Australia. But once the mortgage rates started to climb this was no longer feasible.

Work-life balance.
Okay well, let me just start by saying that is the worst thing about Thailand. One thing that seems to be an injustice is the amount of work Thai people are expected to do.

Most Thai people are working 6 days and working very long hours.

At the time, I wondered if Thai industrialization was influenced by the Korean experience as I had heard that people there were devoted to their companies and worked excessive hours.

For Westerners, it wasn't so bad, but without a second source of income, you are always worried about how much things cost, so you can't enjoy yourself as much as you might like.

I felt the pressure of death all around me. It was coursing through my veins. It was traveling up from my arm and through my chest, as though my own blood was attacking me.
I finally fell asleep. Meditating while listening to the audiobook of one of Eckhart Tolle's retreats had saved me yet again.
At the time, I was living in Nyah, surely one of Australia's smallest and most remote towns. 

I had bought a house, and I felt happier that year. Not happy but happier. I still felt stuck, I felt the limitations of life cramping in upon me. But that was not atypical for me. Even though I felt stuck that house brought me happiness. I loved living there and it gave me a sense of peace to return home each day. Despite working in a job I hated, there was something about that house that made me feel alive. It was a small weatherboard, but I suppose because I experienced so much in the year, I was there in that small house these memories will always stay with me and will be so treasured.
What made that house special was that it represented the desire to succeed. It was in my small weatherboard house in Nyah that I raised pets for the first time. I had a mischievous cat, several chickens and a dog, which belonged to my housemate. I took on 3 jobs, including my main work and some tutoring done on the internet. I also invested in stocks and crypto and I set up an online business, selling items on Amazon and eBay. My finances were getting in order and I had two properties in my name with easily affordable mortgage payments. 
Covid Vaccine Mandates

 

However, when covid hit, I was thrown a curveball. In many ways, the government restrictions benefited me and made for some interesting escapades. But, then it became extreme that the government threw their citizens under the bus for the profits of big pharma. Like many people, I was determined not to take the vaccine. So of course I lost my job, and I found myself living in the Nyah house, losing thousands of dollars each month eating into my savings and starting to get desperate.
In some ways it was tragic because that year was the year, I had started to implement the recommendations from the book Your Money or Your Life. I was saving and investing upwards of 40% of my income and I was running various side hustles such as tutoring, Bitcoin mining and the Amazon store, which had finally started to see some sales.
As I said earlier, because it was still a low-interest rate environment, I was easily able to afford the mortgages on both properties. 


 
Bitcoin is an amazing technology. 

Losing money

Having met some millionaires who had lost everything, I was always amazed at how rich people could lose all their money and end up poor. Sadly, I found out the hard way. You lose your money slowly at first then quickly.
Anyway, at the end of the year 2020, the Bitcoin price peaked at around $ 93,000. It seemed like a magical investment that was only going to go up. Anyway, I took $ 50,000 out of my mortgage as a redraw, thinking I might make a hundred thousand dollars on my money. Rather, Bitcoin started to plummet. It lost around 80% of its value over the following year, which was when I had no work and very little income.
 ...
This is where the vaccine comes in. The death vax.
I was desperate to leave the country, so I decided to take the vaccine and go and live in Thailand with a woman I had met on the internet.
I might die I thought, but I might also have some happiness before I die.
I remember the strangest feelings the day I took the vaccine. I remember lying in bed tossing and turning. I had struggled for weeks with the idea of taking the COVID shot, considering it one of the most evil and insidious invasions over our personal lives in modern history. I found it difficult to fall asleep. Despite dosing myself with vitamin D and strong pain medication, the pain in my arm was significant and I could feel the pain stretch out across my chest working its way to my heart as though an octopus were reaching out its tentacles to grasp every part of my body and crush the life out of it, or as though a parasite were gradually colonizing every part of my flesh and absorbing it so as the grow by what it feeds upon.

    { id: 3, date: "Feb 20, 2025", title: "Money or Your Life", preview:"Consciousness with money will save you many headaches", image: image1, content: `It's fair to say I've had a turbulent time with money. I suppose most people have. Everything to do with money is hard. Even now, I find there are weeks where I spend too much or wish some of the bills would go away or I could magically earn more.
However, there was a time when I thought things might just work out when I finally felt I was on top of my relationship with money. I felt I could become wealthy, or I could at least have more than enough money to do what I wanted.
So, a couple of years ago, I went through a phase of reading books on personal development and wealth building. I'm not sure why I was reading them and perhaps in hindsight it was a bad idea, or it wasn't a good thing.  After all, I had undergone a divorce at the time, and it seemed it was too late in life for me to turn things around or in any way shape or form live a successful life but at the time I really started to believe I could do it.

Being conscious of money
 



So anyway, I started to read the book and one of the first things they advise you to do, and which is quite helpful in my view, is to write down every cent you spend and every cent you earn. Its purpose is to bring consciousness to what you do with your money.
This step is helpful, and it does help you to realize where you are spending money mindlessly on things that don’t bring you value. It should also help you in terms of deciding where you can better allocate your spending.
This is what is known as a defensive strategy. It will not help you to make more money, but it might help you to save and invest more. The trouble with this strategy is that it can take many years of scrimping and saving to succeed financially. In other books I have read, they denounce this strategy as too negative and too risky, and of course when you are a bit older, obviously there is less time to make good financially.
So, you are probably better off if you have a more aggressive strategy than the one outlined in the book if you really want to become wealthy.
But anyway, I started to record the expenses and the income, and it gave me a picture of what I was spending at least even though it didn’t help me to make more money.
Ways to make more money
The book does have some offensive strategies, and ways to make more money and some of these are helpful but it is more about extreme frugality and the benefits of this over the long term. At the time I did some tutoring, and I investigated the side hustle of selling items on Amazon. There were months when I made a substantial amount of money as I also did exam marking. I also had a housemate paying to rent one of the rooms in my house, so this was another reliable source of weekly income.
